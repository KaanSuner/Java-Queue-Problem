# Java-Queue-Problem
##Rules
* Jobs take turns to be processed in First-in First-out manner.
* At each turn, one job can run maximum 100 milliseconds (quantum time): 
  * If the execution/remaining execution time for the job is less than 100ms , I.e 30 ms, the job
leaves the queue at the end of 30 ms.
  * If the execution/remaining execution time for the job is 100ms, it leaves the queue after the
quantum time is over.
  * If the execution/remaining execution time for the job is over, after 100ms the job is dequeued
and enqueued back to the job queue and waits for its next turn.
* The processes should be executed until the queue is empty.
### Sample input: 
1. Job0 ,0 ,250
